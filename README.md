### Welcome to PyGame4Starters. Here, you can find some very helpful scripts I've written that can help you start your PyGame adventure.
Below is a quick guide to each of the files that you can use in order to start your game.

## TIP!!
### It's advisable to read the code before you begin coding. Click on the .py file to view the code.
Otherwise, feel free to clone this repository onto your local machine and begin coding!

## Files at a glance

- **maingame.py**: This file contains a thorough, more hands-on approach to coding your game. Here, you can see what's happening at the beginning of a PyGame runtime session (recommended for all users) and manipulate accordingly.
- **main_game.py**: This file is a much simpler script. Here, the screen logic is done for you, so all you really need to do is define its width, height, and how many FPS you want your game to run at.
- **screen.py**: This is the class file that handles the screen. If you are a beginner, the logic may not make sense (at first). However, reading this class file to see how it works and what logic is being used is *highly* recommended.
- **class1.py**: This is a class template file. This is where you will put all of your logic for each object you make. Copy and paste this with each class so that you can see how it's used, called, and how you can program it to do whatever you need it to do.


## HOW TO GET STARTED
I'll be publishing a YouTube tutorial and linking it here. This library is complete and you won't need to do anything else except to add your own game logic to it and start coding. This should make starting your coding journey much easier, with game code that's so much better to handle.

## Support
This is, of course, open source. As such, there are no warantees nor working guarantees. Everything uses the pygame module so you will need to get that before you can use these files. Simply go to your command prompt/power shell **as administrator** or your linux terminal (you'll need to `sudo` in order to install PyGame. **DO NOT `su`** as there's no need. `sudo` will suffice.

To get PyGame:

`
pip install pygame
`

That should be it. 

Make sure your pip is up to date. Use `python -m update pip` or `python3 -m update pip` to update to the latest pip repository.
